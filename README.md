# VendorBot (Destiny 2)
This is a discord bot written in Python which checks Destiny 2 vendors once daily for items of interest.
It is designed to be low-bandwidth, intermittantly querying vendor inventory for items of interest.

For example, if a Gnawing Hunger weapon is at a vendor with both Subsistence and Demolitionist perks, VendorBot will notify the discord user who registered an interest in that combination.
